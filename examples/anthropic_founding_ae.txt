Anthropic - Founding Account Executive (Enterprise AI)

About Anthropic:
Anthropic is an AI safety company building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We're the creators of Claude, our AI assistant. We're looking for a founding enterprise sales team member to help us scale Claude for Enterprise.

The Role:
As one of our first Enterprise AEs, you'll build the playbook for selling Claude to large enterprises. This is a founding role—you'll define territory strategy, shape messaging with Product/Marketing, and establish the enterprise motion from the ground up.

What You'll Do:
- Own full sales cycle for $100K-$500K deals with 3-6 month cycles
- Build pipeline in Financial Services, Healthcare, Legal, or Tech verticals
- Multi-thread across technical buyers (Engineering, Product, Security) and business buyers (CIO, CTO, Business Unit leaders)
- Partner with Product team to influence roadmap based on enterprise customer needs
- Work with Solutions Engineering to architect deployments
- Establish best practices for enterprise selling that future AEs will follow

What We're Looking For:
- 7+ years enterprise software sales experience
- Proven track record selling to technical buyers (Engineering, Product, IT)
- Experience with $100K+ ACV deals, 3-6 month sales cycles
- Comfort in ambiguity—you've built territories or sales motions from scratch before
- Deep curiosity about AI and ability to have technical conversations with engineers
- Bonus: Experience selling developer tools, infrastructure, or API-first products

Why Anthropic:
- Founding sales role—define the playbook, don't just execute it
- Work directly with Product/Engineering teams to shape enterprise features
- Competitive comp: $150K base + OTE $300K+ (uncapped commission)
- Equity in a fast-growing AI company
- Be part of building safe, beneficial AI systems

Location: San Francisco (hybrid) or Remote (US)
